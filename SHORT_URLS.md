# Short URL Feature for NexChat

## Overview

The short URL feature automatically creates shortened, user-friendly links when users upload images and documents in the chat. This makes file sharing more convenient and provides a better user experience.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Short Link Generation
- When a user uploads a file (image, document, video, audio), the system automatically creates a short URL
- Short URLs follow the format: `https://yourdomain.com/f/{shortId}`
- The short ID is a 6-character alphanumeric string

### 2. File Display in Chat
- Files are displayed with their original name and a shortened link
- Users can click the short link to access the file
- The short link includes copy and open functionality

### 3. File Access Page
- Short URLs redirect to a dedicated file access page (`/f/[id]`)
- The page shows file information and provides download options
- Users can copy the original URL or download the file directly

## Features

### Supported File Types
- Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
- Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
- Audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
- Any other file type

### User Interface
- **Compact Display**: Short links appear below file content in a compact format
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copy of short URLs
- **Open in New Tab**: Direct access to files
- **File Information**: Shows file name and type

### Security
- Short links are stored locally (localStorage) for demo purposes
- In production, these should be stored in a secure database
- Links can be made to expire after a certain time period

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `ShortLinkDisplay`: Reusable component for displaying short links
- `FileUpload`: Updated to handle short URL creation
- `ChatWindow`: Updated to display short links in messages
- File redirect page: `/app/f/[id]/page.tsx`

### Utilities
- `createShortLink()`: Generates short URLs
- `getOriginalUrl()`: Retrieves original URLs from short IDs
- `copyToClipboard()`: Handles copying to clipboard
- `formatFileDisplayName()`: Formats file names for display

### Database Storage
Currently uses localStorage for demo purposes:
```javascript
{
  "shortId": {
    "url": "original-file-url",
    "fileName": "original-file-name",
    "createdAt": timestamp
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: Store short links in Firestore or another database
2. **Link Expiration**: Add expiration dates to short links
3. **Access Control**: Add password protection for sensitive files
4. **Analytics**: Track link usage and downloads
5. **Custom Domains**: Allow custom short URL domains
6. **Bulk Operations**: Generate short links for multiple files

## Usage Examples

### Uploading a File
1. User selects a file in the chat
2. File is uploaded to Firebase Storage
3. Short URL is automatically generated
4. File appears in chat with short link

### Sharing a File
1. User clicks on a short link in chat
2. File access page opens
3. User can download or copy the original URL
4. File is accessible to anyone with the link

### Copying Links
1. User clicks the copy button on a short link
2. Link is copied to clipboard
3. Success feedback is shown
4. Link can be shared via other platforms

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables are required for the basic functionality.

### Customization
- Modify `generateShortId()` to change short ID format
- Update `createShortLink()` to use different URL patterns
- Customize `ShortLinkDisplay` component styling
- Add additional file type support in `FileService`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Links not working**: Check if localStorage is available and not full
2. **File not found**: Verify the original file URL is still valid
3. **Copy not working**: Ensure clipboard permissions are granted

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for short link creation logs
- Verify localStorage contains the link mappings
- Test file access page directly with known short IDs
